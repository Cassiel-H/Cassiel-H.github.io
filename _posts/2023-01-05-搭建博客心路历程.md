# How did everything started

## "Stalking" my bro (Leo's) git

Yes I have to admit that Leo, as my team member for the course ADBS and CV, is a smart guy who always works hard. Among one of thousands times that I'm stalking [Leo's GitHub](https://github.com/HaonanLyu) to see whether he is more 卷 than me, I discovered [YEY's Blog](https://yey.world/) from Leo's following list.  

That basically introduced a brand new world to me that inspires me, like emmm he's a Master of Data Science student @ Unimelb, so am I; He took those core course and so did I; he might be a good-looking person and yes so am I. 

So why not create a personal blog that I can basically throw every rubbish in here. Yeahhhh, that's how this Cassiel's blog is invented.

Now below are some of the issue I run to when I'm deploying it, I'm not gonna to explain the process in detail, but I've put some reference link I looked when I'm deploying.

* [The official Jekyll website](http://jekyllcn.com/) 
* [Github搭建个人博客（2019最新版,亲测）](https://blog.csdn.net/xudailong_blog/article/details/78762262) 
    * Refer to type 3, BY Blog, YEY's Blog is forked from BY Blog
* [Github+Jekyll 搭建个人网站详细教程](https://www.jianshu.com/p/9f71e260925d)
    * They have the Jekyll's installation part, the breakdown of whole repository's directory which I think is really nice. (like this)
